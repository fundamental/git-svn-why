git svn Where the Hell is the dependencY

aka, why are there so many svn externs?
Why?

Well, while that question will never be answered at least there should be a
quick way to setup a repo with svn externs and pretend that they don't exist.

What does it do?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given a repository path in an svn repo, the root of the svn repo, and an output
dir it gathers up the repository and all transitive dependencies (via
waaaaaaaaaayyyy too many svn externs) together. Then it checks out all
repositories with git-svn, limiting history to 50 commits to keep that operation
going at a reasonable pace.
Once all sub-repos are checked out, then it adds symbolic links in place of all
svn externs.

Some effort to combine multiple copies of svn sub-repos is done.
It mostly works and seems to work slightly better than some of the other svn-ext
tools, but I'm not going to say it works well.
